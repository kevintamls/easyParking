# streetParkingSafe: A concept for smart street parking in Hong Kong

## A submission from Team Degenerate

A proof of concept for smart parking for Hong Kong where number of on street parking far outweighs demand. The application would be able to leverage IOT enabled devices such as pressure sensors physically installed on the ground and in the future image recognition technology using neural networks to detect the occupancy of on street parking in any particular street and offer a 3 colour model (red, amber, green) to show likelihood of space availibility both in real time and in the future.
